Solutions to some of the problems and my overall progress on different online judge platforms

## Programming language
Although most solutions are programmed in C++, that's not always the case; some might use other languages.

Every problem solution in this repository is headed with some information about it. There will always be name of the problem, link to it and date/time of the submission. Other headers might vary; however they usually will contain information about run time, usage of memory and other technical details, provided by online judge
