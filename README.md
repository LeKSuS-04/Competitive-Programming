# Competitive Programming
[Total problems solved badge](.github/badges/total-solved.svg)

This repository contains my solutions to some of the problems from various 
competetive programming platforms, such as CodeForces, CodeChef, etc.

Each and every solution has information about the problem at the top. I put
link to the problem there, as well as technical parts of a solution, such
as verdict, run time, memory consumption, etc.
